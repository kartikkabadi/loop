# 🐠 ClawSweeper

ClawSweeper is a conservative OpenClaw maintainer tool for one-cluster issue and PR cleanup.

It takes a curated GitHub issue/PR cluster, asks a Codex worker to classify the items, and applies only narrow, auditable cleanup actions when the evidence is strong. It shares the same ClawSweeper repo and GitHub App as the commit and backlog sweepers, but runs as a separate repair lane with stricter mutation gates.

Allowed automated close reasons:

- duplicate of a clear canonical thread
- superseded by a clear canonical thread
- fixed by a specific candidate fix

Manual backlog-cleanup jobs may also use
[`instructions/low-signal-prs.md`](instructions/low-signal-prs.md) for
drive-by PRs that are clearly blank-template, docs-only discoverability churn,
test-only coverage spam, refactor-only noise, third-party capabilities that
belong on ClawHub, risky unapproved infra, or dirty branches. This policy is
opt-in per job and should return `needs_human` for plausible bug fixes or
anything with active maintainer signal.

Everything else stays open or is escalated for maintainer review.

Security-sensitive reports are deliberately out of scope. ClawSweeper
routes those refs to central OpenClaw security handling and keeps processing
unrelated ordinary bugs, provider gaps, and duplicate cleanup in the same
cluster. It follows OpenClaw `SECURITY.md`: trusted-operator exec behavior,
provider gaps, feature gaps, and hardening-only parity drift are not treated as
vulnerabilities unless there is a real trust-boundary bypass.

## Status

The repair lane is intentionally narrower than the sweep lanes. The sweepers scan OpenClaw commits and backlog items on a cadence; repair handles targeted clusters that were already grouped by a human, gitcrawl, or another dedupe tool.

Cluster discovery currently comes from [openclaw/gitcrawl](https://github.com/openclaw/gitcrawl).

The default workflow is proposal-first. It does not comment or close unless a job is explicitly promoted and the deterministic applicator confirms live GitHub state has not changed.

## State Boundaries

`jobs/` and `results/` are durable operational state, not generated source. They may contain historical run text and audit evidence. Active code, prompts, workflows, docs, schemas, and tests are covered by `pnpm run check:active-surface`, which rejects retired project names and old token variables before the full gate runs.

## Dashboard

Live dashboard: https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper-dashboard

## How It Works

For a maintainer-facing architecture map of the automation lanes, see
[`docs/INTERNAL_FEATURES.md`](docs/INTERNAL_FEATURES.md).

For the ClawSweeper feedback loop that updates existing generated PRs, see
[`docs/repair/auto-update-prs.md`](auto-update-prs.md).

That loop is marker-driven. ClawSweeper comments use hidden
`clawsweeper-verdict:*` markers, and only actionable PR feedback includes
`clawsweeper-action:fix-required`. ClawSweeper skips stale head SHAs and caps
automatic repairs at ten per PR and one per PR head SHA.

Maintainers can opt an existing PR into the bounded repair-only loop with
`/clawsweeper autofix`, or into the bounded merge loop with
`/clawsweeper automerge`. Autofix adds `clawsweeper:autofix`, dispatches
ClawSweeper for the current head, and lets ClawSweeper repair trusted
`needs-changes` findings for up to ten rounds without merging. Automerge adds
`clawsweeper:automerge` and can merge only after a trusted pass verdict for the
exact current head plus a non-draft PR, green checks, clean mergeability, and
explicit `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_MERGE=1` and `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_AUTOMERGE=1` gates.

ClawSweeper commit findings have a separate intake lane. A
`clawsweeper_commit_finding` dispatch fetches the latest markdown commit report,
writes an audit record under `results/commit-findings/`, and only sends the
finding into the PR executor when the issue is narrow, non-security, and still
worth repairing on latest `main`.

Each cluster job:

1. Starts from one markdown job file under `jobs/`.
2. Hydrates the listed issue/PR refs and first-hop linked refs.
3. Builds a cluster plan and fix artifact for autonomous jobs.
4. Runs Codex with repo-local policy prompts and JSON output schema in a read-only sandbox.
5. Writes structured run artifacts under `.clawsweeper-repair/runs/`.
6. Reviews the worker artifact with deterministic safety checks.
7. Executes credited fix artifacts through `scripts/execute-fix-artifact.ts` when the fix gate is open: repair a writable contributor branch first, treating same-repo head branches as writable even when GitHub reports `maintainer_can_modify=false`; otherwise raise a narrow replacement PR, copy source labels, add non-bot source PR authors as replacement co-authors, and close the uneditable source PR after the replacement push succeeds.
8. Applies guarded close/comment and explicit merge actions through `scripts/apply-result.ts`.
9. Publishes a sanitized result ledger back to this repo under `results/`, `jobs/openclaw/closed/`, and `repair-apply-report.json`; the external dashboard renders from that ledger.

Codex does not receive a GitHub token during classification. The runner preflights GitHub state before model execution, then Codex receives those artifacts and returns JSON only. When a reviewed fix artifact is executed, Codex gets a temporary target checkout without GitHub credentials; the deterministic executor owns commit, push, PR creation, and source-PR closeout using the short-lived GitHub App token exposed to the executor as `GH_TOKEN`. Commit author metadata defaults to `clawsweeper-repair` and can be overridden with `CLAWSWEEPER_GIT_USER_NAME` and `CLAWSWEEPER_GIT_USER_EMAIL`; this is separate from the GitHub token used to push. The applicator re-fetches the target item, checks `updated_at`, blocks unsafe closeouts, writes idempotent close comments, closes supported duplicate/superseded/fixed-by-candidate actions, and can squash-merge explicitly allowed clean PR actions.

Merge is deliberately harder than closeout. A merge action must include `merge_preflight` proving security clearance, resolved human comments, resolved review-bot findings, a passed Codex `/review`, addressed review findings, and clean validation commands. The fix executor runs an agentic edit/review loop before it writes a fix PR: edit, validate, Codex `/review`, address findings, revalidate, and resolve PR review threads when permitted. The applicator also checks live unresolved GitHub review threads immediately before merge.

Replacement fix work uses a recoverable target branch named `clawsweeper/<cluster-id>`. The executor resumes that branch if it already exists and pushes checkpoint commits after agent edits and review-fix edits, adding `Co-authored-by` trailers for non-bot source PR authors when a contributor PR is replaced. It then opens or updates the PR only after validation and Codex `/review` pass. If `/review` still blocks the merge after retries, the run writes a blocked fix report and leaves the checkpoint branch recoverable instead of losing the patch.

Runs for the same job path and mode are queued instead of running concurrently. The workflow uses Node 24, `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` for cluster planning/review, and `blacksmith-16vcpu-ubuntu-2404` for fix/apply execution. Fix execution prepares the target checkout with Corepack and the target `pnpm` package manager before validation; the execution job caches Codex, npm, Corepack, and the target pnpm store. Fix validation is pinned to OpenClaw's fast changed-lane posture by default: `pnpm check:changed` plus diff checks are the hard local gate, and target validation commands normalize to `pnpm check:changed` unless `CLAWSWEEPER_TARGET_VALIDATION_MODE=strict` or `CLAWSWEEPER_STRICT_TARGET_VALIDATION=1` is explicitly set. Unrelated flaky main CI, broad `pnpm check`, full tests, live, docker, and e2e lanes do not block narrow ClawSweeper Repair fixes by default.

Full worker prompts, Codex transcripts, and raw artifacts stay in GitHub Actions. The committed ledger keeps only the cluster summary, run URL, action counts, apply outcomes, closed targets, and human-review entries.

## Modes

- `plan`: produces recommendations only.
- `execute`: can apply reviewed safe close and explicit clean merge actions from structured JSON.
- `autonomous`: adds live cluster preflight and fix-artifact generation. It may recommend and drive a canonical fix path; direct mutation still goes through the fix executor and applicator gates.
- `route_security`: quarantines true security-sensitive refs without poisoning unrelated cluster work.
- `needs_human`: only product-direction, trust-boundary, canonical-choice, merge-path, or contributor-credit decisions that remain unclear after the hydrated artifact and single-item review/check/decide pass.
- Automated reviewer feedback must be cleared during autonomous PR work. Greptile, Codex, Asile, CodeRabbit, Copilot, and similar bot comments must be addressed, proven non-actionable, or escalated before any merge or post-merge closeout recommendation.
- Merge preflight: no PR can merge until `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_MERGE=1`, security issues are cleared, comments are resolved, Codex `/review` has passed, findings are addressed, and changed-surface validation is clean. With the merge gate closed, ClawSweeper Repair labels merge-ready targets for human review instead of merging.
- Final base sync: before pushing a repaired branch, ClawSweeper fetches latest `origin/main`. If main moved after validation, the worker rebases again; conflict resolution goes back through Codex, then validation and Codex `/review` rerun before the branch can be pushed.
- Repair ladder: make the useful contributor PR mergeable when its branch is writable; same-repo PRs are writable by the GitHub App contents permission even when the raw maintainer-edit flag is false. Otherwise replace draft, stale, unmergeable, uneditable, or unsafe branches with a narrow credited fix PR. When fix PR mode is enabled, "wait or replace" is already answered: replace, preserve credit and labels, then supersede only the source PR that could not be safely updated.

## Maintainer Comment Commands

ClawSweeper can route maintainer comments from target repositories back into the
cloud repair workflow. It recognizes both command styles:

```text
/clawsweeper status
@openclaw-clawsweeper status
@clawsweeper status
```

Accepted mentions are `@clawsweeper`, `@clawsweeper[bot]`,
`@openclaw-clawsweeper`, or `@openclaw-clawsweeper[bot]`.

Only maintainers can trigger it. The router checks GitHub `author_association`
and accepts `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, and `COLLABORATOR` by default. Contributor and
unknown comments are ignored without a reply.

Supported commands:

```text
/review
/clawsweeper status
/clawsweeper re-review
/clawsweeper fix ci
/clawsweeper address review
/clawsweeper rebase
/clawsweeper autofix
/clawsweeper automerge
/clawsweeper approve
/clawsweeper explain
/clawsweeper stop
@clawsweeper re-review
@clawsweeper review
@openclaw-clawsweeper fix ci
@clawsweeper why did automerge stop here?
```

`status` and `explain` post a short status reply. `review` and `re-review`
dispatch ClawSweeper review again for an open issue or PR. `fix ci`, `address review`,
and `rebase` dispatch the normal `repair-cluster-worker.yml` repair path, but only for
existing ClawSweeper PRs identified by the `clawsweeper/*` branch.
Freeform maintainer mentions such as `@clawsweeper why did automerge stop here?`
dispatch a read-only assist review. The answer lands in the next ClawSweeper
comment; action-looking prose can only become existing structured
recommendations and still passes the normal deterministic gates.
`autofix` opts an open PR into the bounded review/fix loop and never merges.
`automerge` opts an open PR into the bounded review/fix/merge loop, but draft
PRs stay fix-only until GitHub marks them ready for review. `approve` is
maintainer-only exact-head approval after a human-review pause; it clears pause
labels and merges only when the normal automerge readiness checks and merge
gates pass. `stop` labels the item for human review.

The router writes an idempotency marker into each reply and records processed
comments in `results/comment-router.json`. The scheduled workflow is dry by
default; set `CLAWSWEEPER_COMMENT_ROUTER_EXECUTE=1` to let scheduled runs post
replies and dispatch workers.

## GitHub Actions Setup

The workflow needs:

- Codex/OpenAI authentication for model execution
- a read-only GitHub token for worker inspection
- a separate write-scoped GitHub token for the deterministic applicator
- execution gates that default closed: set `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_EXECUTE=1` and `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_FIX_PR=1` only for an intentional execution window; otherwise execute/autonomous dispatches render plan-only output and skip mutation steps
- merge is separately gated by `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_MERGE`; automerge additionally requires `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_AUTOMERGE`; both default to `0`, and merge-ready PRs are labeled `clawsweeper:human-review` and `clawsweeper:merge-ready` for a maintainer to merge manually
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_CODEX_CLI_VERSION` variable to pin and refresh the cached Codex CLI
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_MODEL` override for dispatch scripts; default Codex model is `gpt-5.5`
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_LIVE_WORKERS` variable for dispatch/requeue/self-heal worker fan-out; default is `50`
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_ACTIVE_PRS_PER_AREA` variable for replacement PR backpressure; default is `50` open ClawSweeper PRs per touched area, `0` disables the area cap, and common changelog/release-note files are ignored for this check
- ClawSweeper commit-finding repair PRs are labeled `clawsweeper:commit-finding`
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS` and `CLAWSWEEPER_FIX_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS` variables; worker planning defaults to 30 minutes, while fix execution defaults to a 20 minute Codex budget inside the 30 minute build-PR step so timeout artifacts can be written
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_CODEX_REVIEW_ATTEMPTS` and `CLAWSWEEPER_RESOLVE_REVIEW_THREADS` variables for agentic merge-prep review loops
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_REPAIRS_PER_PR` and
  `CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_REPAIRS_PER_HEAD` variables for trusted
  ClawSweeper review feedback; defaults are `10` automatic repair iterations per
  PR and `1` repair per PR head SHA. The per-PR cap is total across changing
  head SHAs and stops the automatic review/repair loop.
- optional `CLAWSWEEPER_COMMENT_ROUTER_EXECUTE=1` to let the scheduled comment
  router respond to maintainer-only `/clawsweeper ...` and
  `@clawsweeper ...` / `@openclaw-clawsweeper ...` commands. Without it,
  scheduled runs only write a dry report.

Keep exact secret names, token scopes, and execution-window procedures in private operations docs or repository settings notes. Do not put token values or live operational credentials in job files.
